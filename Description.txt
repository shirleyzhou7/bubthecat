Chatbot description:

I changed two files and added another from the original code scaffolding: 
I changed Runv4.py and Settingsv2.py (very slightly) and added Chatbot.py.
Settingsv2.py points to my personal channel's twitch stream (https://www.twitch.tv/camrawne_dev)
to listen and process chat stuff.
I simply added a line in Runv4.py that calls the processCommands() function whenever 
a private message is recieved. The code in Chatbot is very simple and adds a processCommands() 
function that parses an input message for one of the two implemented commands. 
The two commands are: 
- !encourageme 
    The bot responds by saying something nice about the person that called the command.
- !sassme
    The bot says something sassy. More directed at the streamer than the player calling it.

To run, do:
python Runv4.py and go to https://www.twitch.tv/camrawne_dev. Try typing in one of the commands and see the magic happen.
